Javascript Arrow Function:https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-arrow-functions/

In javascript every function is an object. An object is a collection of key:value pairs. If a value is a primitive (integer, string, boolean), or another object, the value is considered a property. If a value is a function, it is called a 'method'.

Don't define function using "function" keyword in function definition in react.

React JS uses JSX. (syntax extension to JavaScript)
React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid.

example:
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

Babel converts JSX to Javascript.

We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.

JSX Prevents Injection Attacks.

Props can be any name in stateless component(not in stateful-class based).state isnot available in stateless.
we may have more than one ReactDOM methods.

onClick, onChange, etc event function starts with ()=>{} not directly {} in tag

no state manipulation in render method. (pure function)

ctrl+del to remove all spaces in any editors.

Binding:

Don't log after setState. it's async so run in background.

Don't user this.state.anyname inside setState, instead, pass the function in setState. ex. this.setState((state,props)=>{})

if function is arrow function in argument then binding is not required.

not getElementById, instead use JSX in tag property

installed babel/sublime extension and esLint (for error checking)

props passing in constructor is used to use of props in state in constructor. without it props can be undefined.

JSX is converted to React.createElement('div',{class},React.getElementById...) So importing React is must.

Component name should be start with capital character.

Don't directly assign current to obj because it create reference which changes both when we change a single

Functional Components (also called presentational, dumb, stateless) (Class based components may also be stateless)
Class based Components (also called containers, smart, stateful)
user Functional Components as many as possible.

onClick={this.funName} ...dont do '()' after function name because it would execute method when render() is called.
we only pass the reference.
another way is to use like onClick={() => this.funName(arg)} when we want to pass arguments. (inefficient)

CSS Style auto add styles for all browsers. (lik webkit,..etc)
